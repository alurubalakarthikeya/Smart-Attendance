<h1>Smart Attendance Project</h1><p><b>Automated Attendance:</b> Students scan their IDs using QR when entering and leaving the lecture hall.<br><b>Database Check:</b> The system verifies the ID with the university database for accurate attendance.<br><b>Admin Dashboard:</b> Professors can view and manage attendance through a simple web interface.</p><p>The use of QR code for ID scanning and integration with a database for attendance tracking is technically viable. Technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB are well-suited for this implementation. Protecting sensitive student data from unauthorized access or breaches requires strong security measures. Students and faculty may need time to adapt to the new system, and there could be resistance or usability issues. Improves accuracy and efficiency in large lecture halls. This will streamline the attendance process, reducing errors and saving time for both students and faculty. Reduces the need for physical attendance sheets.</p> Made in collab with my friends  <a style="color: blue" href="https://github.com/ArjiJethin" target=_blank>"Arji Jethin"</a> & <a style="color: red" href="https://github.com/ayushsingh08-dsa" target=_blank>"ASH"</a>. <br>Project Link: <a href="https://alurubalakarthikeya.github.io/Smart-Attendance/">Open</a>
